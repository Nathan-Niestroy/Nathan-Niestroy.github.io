        <h2>About This Website</h2>
        <p>This website serves as a showcase for both my current projects and past work in Computer Science, IT, and Cybersecurity. It includes projects like this website itself, where I've learned how to host web pages on GitHub and gained hands-on experience coding in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This site also highlights previous projects that have contributed to my growth and expertise in these fields.</p>
